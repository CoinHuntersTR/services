**ZERϴ Network** is the first EVM-compatible rollup that eliminates the need for gas entirely within the network.

Despite the improvements in crypto UX, gas fees are still a significant barrier. Gas is complicated, confusing and painful. To overcome gas once and for all and effectively set a new standard for onchain UX, we leveraged the ZK Stack.

ZERϴ Network will be completely gasless, meaning that any token can be used to pay network fees. We also designed a custom paymaster which will enable us to cover all transaction costs for Zerion wallet users and is open to all dApp developers.
