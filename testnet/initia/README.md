Initia is a network that combines Layer 1 (L1) technology with application-specific Layer 2 (L2) infrastructure, aiming to create scalable and interconnected blockchains. By fusing L1 with L2, Initia simplifies the process for developers to launch application-specific blockchains as L2s, offering features such as native stablecoins, multi-chain bridging, and more. Initia's architecture abstracts complexities from traditional modular and multi-chain systems, making it easier for developers to create scalable and sovereign blockchain systems.
