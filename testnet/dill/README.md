Dill is a sharding-based data availability network designed for scalability and security. It is fully compatible with the Danksharding roadmap, utilizing advanced subnet sharding, KZG commitments, and a robust Distributed Hash Table (DHT) to optimize data sampling and reduce reliance on DAS providers. Dill achieves 10x to 100x scalability compared to other data availability networks, sharing security with both Bitcoin and Ethereum. The network supports up to 1,000,000 validators, offering a highly scalable and secure solution for data availability.
