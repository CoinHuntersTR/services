Sunrise is a specialized Data Availability (DA) Layer for Proof of Liquidity. It is designed to enhance the current playing field and drive the new modular paradigm forward through unique added functionalities. Synergy between Sunrise and [Gluon](http://gluon.zone/) (Sunrise’s sister project — our strategic yield hub) enables **DA fee abstraction** and **sovereign proof of liquidity** for users of the Sunrise DA layer. Added ecosystem benefits, such as integration with **rollups as a service** (RAAS**)** providers and support for **restaking,** further enhance the Sunrise user experience. Sunrise is on a mission to drive modularity forward with a focus on liquidity and sovereignty.
