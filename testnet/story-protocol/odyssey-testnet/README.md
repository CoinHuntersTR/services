Story Protocol is a web3 technology that aims to transform storytelling by providing infrastructure for creators to build narrative universes and imaginary worlds using open source principles. It enables the creation, governance, and licensing of intellectual property on the blockchain, allowing for the development of an ecosystem of modular story components that can be remixed and combined in new and innovative ways.
