Pipe Network is an incentivized internet infrastructure project that aims to revolutionize content delivery networks (CDN) by using blockchain technology. It allows users to contribute their computing power to expand CDN nodes and improve content delivery. By leveraging crypto incentives, Pipe plans to enhance the speed and efficiency of data transfer, reducing latency caused by geographical distances. The project is built on the Solana blockchain and is expected to launch its testnet during the Breakpoint conference in Singapore.
